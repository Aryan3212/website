## Transcript (lightly edited)

Hi, I'm Aryan. I'm making this video as a quick intro to who I am, what my goals and ambitions are, and how I think.

Over the past four years as a software engineer, I've worked at a startup and at GoZayaan, and at Optimizely, which is a large enterprise. I've worked across the stack - frontend, backend, and some infrastructure-level work - with code running in production.

In terms of work, I want to build things that have real, lasting impact - on a business, on users, or society - but I need a good reason for why the work matters. That tends to shape the kinds of problems I look for and the kinds of problems I enjoy solving.

Right now I'm interested in a few areas: local-first software, and AI systems like RAG and audio/speech systems.

If you'd like to work with me, feel free to reach out - my email is on this site. Thanks for watching.
