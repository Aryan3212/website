Hi everyone! I'm a software engineer with over 4 years of professional experience. I've worked across the stack - from backend to frontend to a bit of cloud infrastructure - at companies ranging from early-stage startups catering to consumers to enterprise SaaS platforms serving Fortune 100 clients.

What drives me: making sure my work moves towards actual tangible results and delights users.

Here's a diagram of my timeline, it has some extra info you may not need:

## Optimizely (2024-2025)

**Full Stack Software Engineer** | Content Marketing Platform

Joined the product development team at Optimizely's Content Marketing Platform - an enterprise SaaS tool used by companies like Shell and Xerox.

**Highlights:**

- Owned the [Custom URL feature](/post/portfolio/optimizely-custom-url) end-to-end - backend, AWS Lambda, and infrastructure setup that serves over a million requests/day and wrote extensive documentation to support maintenance
- Built features to streamline workflow management, track feature adoption, generate data reports all in all improving user retention and engagement
- Wrote tests and documentation/tech specs to unblock features, so that team can focus on more impactful projects
- Resolved 4 SLA-bound customer issues, saving >$10,000 on each resolved issue

I got this role despite lacking formal backend experience. Self-studied backend engineering through projects and courses, and performed well in system design interviews.

## What I'm Exploring Now

Local-first software: Software that doesn't need the cloud to survive.

Audio AI research: Investigating speech processing and audio generation. It's a pivot from my standard software engineering work, driven by genuine curiosity about where the field is heading.

## Mistakes I've Learned From

I track my mistakes. Some recurring themes:

- Not taking ownership early enough - waiting for others instead of stepping in

- Overanalyzing instead of shipping small wins and iterating

I'm actively working on these.
