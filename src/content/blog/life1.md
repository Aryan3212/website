## Dreaming of peace

Whenever I have dreams of peace, I get this feeling which feels familiar but something I've never experienced in real life.

Maybe my childhood was peaceful. Do other feel the same way?

These days I feel like I'm in a constant struggle to build my life in a way that I'd like everything to be. Ever since I sort of knew that things, in this state, could be better.

That thought took away my peace. Even more so, when I realized, I had something to do about other people's peace as well.

This feeling which doesn't exist in the real world. Only in distant memories and dreams.

We still have a lot to do.
