## Use Astro as your tool of choice

Astro will give you a perfect score on Lighthouse. Has a great experience when building statically generated sites.

It also has a lot of cool people working on it making it better and designing templates like the one I'm using for this website.

## Use Cloudflare Analytics for analytics

Having a place to see analytics lets you understand what value your website is providing.

The only ways I found to do it for free are Google Analytics(GA) and Cloudflare Web Analytics. The cons of using GA is that it needs you to display a cookie banner and get permissions from your user as it requires some cookies that are not exactly privacy-first. Even though Cloudflare gives you less info it is privacy-first and doesn't need an annoying cookie banner.

Happy building and blogging.
