## You won't ever reach that big goal, if you don't optimize your actions for the largest contribution to your goal.

Most people will optimize based on things that don't contribute even slightly to their goals and then question why they've stagnated.

If you have a goal that is "larger than life", superficial actions won't cut it, unfortunately.
