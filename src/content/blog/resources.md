I put ratings as well as some descriptions here. When I was a beginner, I used to follow along with code for most parts, but as time went by I only look for the concepts that are being taught. Then if I feel like this should be attempted using I code, I start writing some toy code. Like with Redis or Kafka, since these were alien to me when I first started learning them.

### YouTube:

[Sumit Saha](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnwithSumit) (Bangla Content): This is the most in-depth set of content I've seen anywhere. Solidified my understanding of a lot of aspects of development. Here's the playlists I saw fully(5/5):

### Udemy:

(Colt Steele) [Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/): One of the best courses a beginner can take. Set me up with NodeJS, HTML/CSS full-stack development.

5/5

3.9/5 : Teaches a few new Backend/Node.js concepts which aren't connected but useful.

(Stephen Grider) [Microservices built with Node, React, Docker and Kubernetes](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/)(70% completed): Teaches end-to-end building production grade microservices applications. Really teaches stuff you can't find anywhere else.

4/5

(Brad Schiff) [Become a WordPress Developer: Unlocking Power With Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/?couponCode=CPSALEBRAND24): Taught me about interacting a software like Wordpress.

4/5

(Andrei Neagoie)[ The Complete Python Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/?couponCode=CPSALEBRAND24): A good intro to Python and what can be done with Python.

Some courses I did but weren't that great:

1. https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/learn/lecture/807408?start=795#overview (3.5/5)
2. https://www.udemy.com/course/pythoncourse/learn/lecture/20490008#overview (3/5)

[Code with Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/): - Ultimate Django Part 1-3: Teaches a lot about idiomatic Python and good REST API architecture for Django. (4/5)

### Books I read:

- Django for Beginners/Django for APIs: William S. Vincent: Basics of writing Django and Django REST Framework apps.(3/5)
- Head First Object Oriented Analysis and Design: Good book on decomposing software projects but seemed to be rambling too much on certain topics.(3/5)

I realize as I'm writing this that I haven't read that many books end-to-end I normally start and then leave it in the middle. I should fix that :)

### Academic Online Courses:

1. Systematic Program Design by edx: Not really related to web design but keeping here for a record. Teaches functional programming in LISP. Concepts such as worklists.

Plan to do more.
