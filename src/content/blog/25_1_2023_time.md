Summary: You can't do everything.

## Actionable tip: Do Time-blocking. Use a calendar and a routine.

- We can't do everything that seems important in our life. Accept that.
- Some things that really matter are uncomfortable and they will take a significant chunk of your time.
- Don't expect to get everything done. Accept your defeat to time. We can't travel every corner of the world or be a master at every instrument, let's accept that and enjoy what we have in front of us.
- Be grateful and you'll be grateful about this wonderful time. Just be happy. Take a moment to realize this exact moment, if you're reading this you probably have a screen and some free time, that's a blessing.
- Practice doing nothing.
- Rediscover rest and make it an end not a means. Rest should be === doing nothing. Watching TikToks is not rest.
- Feeling fulfilled in the moment. The past and the future are not happening right now.
- Prioritise one thing at a time. People can't multi-process, we only have one brain. When you think you're multitasking you're actually switching between tasks which decreases your productivity and focus.
